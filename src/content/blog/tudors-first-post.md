## Welcome

Hi! Welcome. 

My name is Tudor, I have been coding since 2009. In 2017 I received a Bachelors on IT and since then I have been a practicing software developer. 
Over the years I have worked on a collection of hobby and professional projects, including games, full stack, cloud based websites, cross platform mobile apps, blockchain smart contracts and quantitative trading. 

## OK, so what is the point of this blog? 

While fixing some **shoddy CORS issue** for a work project yesterday, I had a small epiphany: In my almost 8 year software developer career I came across many problems, scenarios and situations which I satisfiably solved at their time, but about which I could not remember neither how nor why. *Funny how the things that make your life **difficult** prompt the deeper questions.*

A majority of these problems were solved using the usual - uncomplicated yet unclimactic solutions: decent enough to allow me to sleep OK at night. They are not the things worth mentioning on this blog. On fewer occasions these problems were solved in ingenious ways that may simplify things further down the line and make my work feel satisfactory and worthwile. These solutions may even be worth noting at times, but neither these are the gist of this blog.

On a handful of occasions however, it truly felt like - excuse my hubris - like king Midas himself ascended from his tomb and typed on my keyboard. These last occurances *do **not** bode well for my sleep*, and for good reason. These I have to note down - to get them off my mind, to help my future self remember and _potentially_ to help somebody else. Also because the humbling experience of putting my perceived illuminated ideas out in public to be brought down to honesty by the collective intelligence of the internet will help me swallow the cold hard truth that most of the time I am not as great as I may think and in the long run I hope that this makes me a better developer and person.

## Reasons

- writing helps (will expand in a future post)
- teaching is the best form of learning
- documenting solutions makes me become a better dev (clarifies thoughts and acts as a future memento)
- publishing software aligns with my long term goals and is a good habit to form 

This blog is my selfish attempt to document all these scenarios, my peace and war time stories for the above reasons. If it turns out to help anybody else we have win-win - here is a way to restore my karmik balance for all the writings I found useful over the years but had no way of rewarding.

Enjoy!

## PS

God, I **love** *writing* in <u>markdown</u>.
